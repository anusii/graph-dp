    "# Differentially Private Egocentric Betweenness Centrality\n",

    "In the paper, the authors descirbe an algorithm to compute a differentially private estimate of the egocentric betweenness centrality (EBC) of a node in a graph. Their algorithm is based on a non-private algorithm that splits the required computations between two players. To make this algorithm differentially private, they use standard differentially private release mechanisms to perturb each message that the players send to one another.\n",
